This bot walks you through the process of creating a new bot that talks to ChatGPT. In order to create that bot, you will need to get an API key from ChatGPT. This key can be obtained here:

Every bot needs an introduction to set the tone and the context of the bot for ChatGPT. This is the first prompt. This defines how ChatGPT is going to reply.
